# Iris virginica Analysis üå∫

This repository provides a detailed exploration of **Iris virginica**, one of the three flower species in the famous Iris dataset. The project utilizes statistical tools and machine learning techniques to analyze and classify this species based on its distinct features.

---

## ‚ö° Brief Overview

The project trains a classification model using the *train* dataset to predict the species of a flower in the *test* dataset. The classification is based on the following features:  
- `sepal length`  
- `sepal width`  
- `petal length`  
- `petal width`

## üìã Summary

**Iris virginica** is one of the three species in the Iris dataset. This repository focuses specifically on:  
- Analyzing the biological characteristics of Iris virginica.  
- Comparing its attributes to other species (Iris setosa and Iris versicolor).  
- Training and evaluating classification models to predict species based on the given features.

## üîç Analysis Details

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Distribution of Iris virginica features.  
   - Correlation analysis between petal and sepal dimensions.  

2. **Data Visualization:**  
   - Scatter plots to explore feature relationships.  
   - Boxplots to compare ranges across species.  

3. **Machine Learning Models:**  
   - Classification models to identify Iris virginica using the specified dimensions.  
   - Performance evaluation of models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM.
